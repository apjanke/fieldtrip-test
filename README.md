Just a tiny script from the FieldTrip tutorials to exercise FieldTrip in
Octave. It works on data that "was acquired by Irina Siminova in a study 
investigating semantic processing of stimuli presented as pictures, 
visually displayed text or as auditory presented words"
([source](http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/tutorial/continuous/)) and
downloaded [from the FieldTrip website](ftp://ftp.fieldtriptoolbox.org/pub/fieldtrip/tutorial/SubjectEEG.zip).
